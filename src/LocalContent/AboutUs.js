    content:`Nadi astrology is one of the most ancient forms of astrology, originating in Tamil Nadu. It is believed that this unique system can reveal details about your past, present, and future.
Can you imagine that records of your life across time are preserved in Tamil Nadu? Remarkably, many believe this to be true.
During the Chola period, the Nadi palm leaves were gathered, organized, and classified under the Chola reign in Tanjore. These manuscripts were later preserved in the Saraswathi Mahal.
The Nadi leaves faced destruction during the Mughal era, when many were burned or lost. Years later, they were rediscovered and safeguarded by a community of Valluvar astrologers from Valathanpattinam, near Vaitheeswaran Koil in Tamil Nadu. Over time, this region came to be recognized as a major center of Siva Nadi Astrology in the country.
Nadi Astrology, practiced primarily in Tamil Nadu, South India, is traditionally believed to contain the recorded destinies of human beings—past, present, and future—inscribed on ancient palm leaves.

    content:`Vaitheeswaran Kovil is a Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva, situated in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, India. The presiding deity, Sri Vaidyanathan, is revered as the God of Healing.
The temple is believed to hold a profound secret, as it is said to preserve records of the births of all people—past, present, and future. It is also one of the nine sacred Navagraha (nine planets) temples. The Nadi palm leaves, authored by the Tamil sage Agathiyar, were originally preserved at the Saraswathi Mahal Library in Tanjore, Tamil Nadu.
During the British rule in India, the colonizers came to know about Nadi astrology and took possession of many of these manuscripts, leaving a large number with their local associates. Some of the leaves were destroyed, while others were auctioned. Eventually, many of them were acquired by families of astrologers in Vaitheeswaran Koil, where they have been carefully preserved and passed down through generations.
